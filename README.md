# projects

Hi,

In order to apply my web development learning and knowledge, I've started building projects as a practice and hosting on GitHub.
Please check and if any feedback, please let me know.

- Color Flipper - To change the background color to random color by clicking on the button available in the page. 
- Counter - Simple counter to count the values, increase, decrease and reset the count to zero.
- Dice Game - Fun multiplayer game. Rules are - Roll a dice to accumulate your score as per the dice count (except when dice count in not One) and hold the score. Your                 score will be reset to zero if in case you don't want to hold your score and want to keep rolling and if you roll One. 
- Guess My Number - Guess the correct number between 0 to 20. You will win if your guess matches with random number generated by system. Highest Score will be if you guess correct number in less number of guesses. 
- Modal - Modal Window to show information effectively to user when clicks on buttons in the UI.
- number_guessing_game - Fun game to guess the correct number between 0 to 100. It will show user previous guesses to help win the game.


Thank you.
